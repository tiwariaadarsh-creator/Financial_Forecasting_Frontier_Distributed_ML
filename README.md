# Spark and PySpark Analytics

## Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA tasks performed:

- Dataset inspection
- Schema analysis
- Missing value checks
- Duplicate checks
- Aggregations
- Spark SQL analytics
- Feature engineering
- Visualizations

### Key Insights

- Most customers did not subscribe to term deposits.
- Management and technician jobs showed higher average balances.
- Call duration strongly influenced subscription likelihood.
- Education level impacted campaign success rates.

---

# Data Parallelism

The dataset was repartitioned to improve distributed execution efficiency.

Implemented Concepts:

- Dataset partitioning

AVG(balance) AS avg_balance
FROM bank
GROUP BY job
ORDER BY avg_balance DESC
```
